 * The base interface to declare an IRequirement.
 * Requirements are defined by the user in a recipe json, they represent an input, an output or a condition to process the recipe.
 * Each IRequirement must be registered to the ForgeRegistry using a {@link RequirementType}.
 * Each IRequirement must have a {@link RequirementIOMode} which is either INPUT or OUTPUT, you can make it fixed or left to the user.
 * Each IRequirement must have a Codec registered with its type, the Codec will be used to deserialize the requirement from json, and send it to the client.
 * Each IRequirement must be associated to an {@link IMachineComponent} the associated component will be passed for each action of the requirement.
 * If any execution method return {@link CraftingResult#error(net.minecraft.network.chat.Component)} the crafting process will be paused and the error shown to the player.
 * The crafting process will be resumed only after the errored requirement return success or pass.
